## ðŸ”­ What I've been working on lately:

### Physician Volunteer Aid Network
As part of my Capstone Design project, my team and I are working with St. Mary's Hospital to develop an application to facilitate volunteering at the medical institution. Currently done manually, the website will allow Doctors and Volunteers to coordinate much more efficiently. The project is currently in Beta testing. 

### Recycling Pioneers
I am volunteering as a Software Engineer for a McGill startup called Recycling Pioneers, where I interned during the summer of 2020. Our goal is to bring a smart waste platform to McGill in order to quantify waste habits, and promote sustainable waste management. Check out my Recycling Pioneers repositories for the [ESP32 Code](https://github.com/arneetsinghkalra/recycling-pioneers-esp32) and the [Official RP Website](https://github.com/arneetsinghkalra/recycling-pioneers-web), which can be visited at [recylingpioneers.ca](https://recyclingpioneers.ca)!
