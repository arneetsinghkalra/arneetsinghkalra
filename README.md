## ðŸ”­ What I've been working on lately:

### Recycling Pioneers
I am volunteering as a Software Engineer for a McGill startup called Recycling Pioneers, where I interned during the summer of 2020. Our goal is to bring a smart waste platform to McGill in order to quantify waste habits, and promote sustainable waste management. Check out my Recycling Pioneers repositories for the [ESP32 Code](https://github.com/arneetsinghkalra/recycling-pioneers-esp32) and the [Official RP Website](https://github.com/arneetsinghkalra/recycling-pioneers-web), which can be visited at [recylingpioneers.ca](https://recyclingpioneers.ca)! 

### I am currently applying for Internships as a Software Engineer for Winter 2021, as well as New Grad Positions beginning Summer 2022. Check out my LinkedIn!
