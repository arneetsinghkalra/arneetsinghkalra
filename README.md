### Hey there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub! My name is Arneet Singh Kalra and I'm a 3rd year Software Engineering Student at McGill University. 

### Projects I've been working on lately:

I am currently interning as a Software Engineer for a McGill startup called Recycling Pioneers. Our goal is to bring a smart waste platform to McGill in order to quantify waste habits, and promote sustainable waste management. Check out my repositories for Recycling Pioneers! 

### I am currently applying for Internships as a Software Engineer for Summer 2021.
