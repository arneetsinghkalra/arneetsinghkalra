```java
class HelloWorld {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      System.out.println("Hello, World! Welcome to my GitHub. 
      My name is Arneet Singh Kalra 
      and I'm a 3rd year Software Engineering Student at McGill University");
}
```

## ðŸ”­ Projects I've been working on lately:

I am currently interning as a Software Engineer for a McGill startup called Recycling Pioneers. Our goal is to bring a smart waste platform to McGill in order to quantify waste habits, and promote sustainable waste management. Check out my Recycling Pioneers repositories for the [ESP32 Code](https://github.com/arneetsinghkalra/recycling-pioneers-esp32) and the [Official RP Website](https://github.com/arneetsinghkalra/recycling-pioneers-web), which can be visited at [recylingpioneers.ca](https://recyclingpioneers.ca)!
